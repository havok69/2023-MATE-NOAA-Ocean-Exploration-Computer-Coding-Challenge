# 2023-MATE-NOAA-Ocean-Exploration-Computer-Coding-Challenge


This GitHub repository showcases our team's work for the MATE / NOAA Ocean Exploration Video Challenge. It includes relevant files, documentation, and resources related to our computer vision team's participation in the competition.

## Competition Details

The MATE / NOAA Ocean Exploration Video Challenge is a global competition that aims to promote innovative technologies and solutions for analyzing underwater videos. The challenge involves analyzing underwater video footage to identify and classify marine life species accurately.

## Contents

1. **Nira_explanation_2023.pdf:** This document provides a comprehensive overview of our computer vision team's approach, methodologies, and results achieved during the challenge.

2. **Nira_spreadsheet_2023.xlsx:** We have included a spreadsheet containing the resulting bounding box coordinates for each of the analyzed videos. These coordinates represent the detected marine life species and their locations in the videos.

3. **2023-OER-MATE-ROV-Computer-Coding-Challenge_FINAL.pdf:** The official problem statement for the MATE / NOAA Ocean Exploration Video Challenge is available here for reference.

4. **Results PDF File:** This document showcases detailed analysis and insights from our computer vision algorithms and the overall performance of our model.

5. **YOLOv7 Results Folder:** We have modified the [official YOLOv7 repository](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7)'s `detect.py` file to tailor it to our specific needs during the competition. The folder contains the modified `detect.py` file along with relevant graphs and analysis derived from the YOLOv7 model.

6. **Winners - 2023 Awards-MATE ROV Competition.v2.pdf:** The results published for the 2023-MATE-NOAA-Ocean-Exploration-Computer-Coding-Challenge
